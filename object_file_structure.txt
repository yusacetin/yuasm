Top-down structure: [32b N_defs] [DEF for each N_defs] [32b N_callers] [CALL for each N_callers] [instructions without symbol links]

N_defs: 32 bits, number of symbol definitions (only section/function names can be symbols)
N_callers: 32 bits, number of symbol callers

DEF structure: [16b len] [symbol_name] [32b loc]

len: 16 bits, length of the symbol name
loc: 32 bits, program counter at where the symbol points to

CALL structure: [16b len] [symbol_name] [32b loc]

len: 16 bits, length of the symbol name
loc: 32 bits, program counter at the control instruction that is expecting the symbol
